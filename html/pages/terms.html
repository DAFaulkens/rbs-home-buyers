In addition to any injunctive relief, you agree to pay to us the total amount of all actual damages (including but not limited to direct, indirect, consequential and incidental damages) caused by any violation of these Terms for which you bear responsibility; except you acknowledge that, for certain Terms violations, actual damages would be extremely difficult or impossible to quantify. Consequently, for such Terms violations, you agree to pay liquidated damages as may be provided for in these Terms. Furthermore, you agree that the amounts of liquidated damages described therein are reasonable estimates of our damages for such violations, and that liquidated damages for violations of these Terms are and will be cumulative.</p>

              <h3>Dispute Resolution / Arbitration</h3>
            </div>

            <p>Any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the use of the Website, to the goods or services provided by Konectpal Invest, or to any acts or omissions for which you may contend Konectpal Invest is liable, including but not limited to any claim or controversy as to arbitrability (“Dispute”), shall be finally, and exclusively, settled by arbitration. The arbitration shall be held before one arbitrator under the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in force at that time. The arbitration shall be venued in consumer location reasonably convenient to the consumer. The arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to the AAA rules. Should no AAA rule regarding the selection of an arbitrator be in effect, the parties shall agree on an arbitrator mutually agreeable to both parties. Should the AAA decline to accept a matter submitted for individual (non-class) arbitration under these Terms of Use, the parties shall jointly select another arbitrator. In the event the parties are unable to agree on a neutral arbitrator, the claimant may file suit in any court of competent jurisdiction solely for the purpose of requesting the appointment of an arbitrator for individual (non-class) arbitration, as provided for in Section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act. To begin the arbitration process, a party must make a written demand therefor.</p>
            <p>Any judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The agreement to arbitrate shall not be construed as an agreement to the joinder or consolidation of arbitration under this agreement with arbitration of disputes or claims of any non-party, regardless of the nature of the issues or disputes involved. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration under this Agreement shall be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to this Agreement, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise.</p>
            <p>THIS AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND Konectpal Invest WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU THUS GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT TO ASSERT OR DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS. YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN OR BRING CLASS ACTIONS. YOUR RIGHTS WILL BE DETERMINED BY NEUTRAL ARBITRATORS AND NOT A JUDGE OR JURY. You are entitled to a fair hearing, and the arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than rules applicable in court. Arbitrator decisions are enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by a court. By using Konectpal Invest's goods, facilities and services, you consent to these restrictions.</p>
            <p>Should a Dispute arise and should the arbitration provisions herein become inapplicable or unenforceable, or in any instance of any lawsuit between you and Konectpal Invest, the parties agree that jurisdiction over and venue of any suit shall be exclusively in the state and federal courts sitting in the State of Texas. If either party employs attorneys to enforce any right in connection with any Dispute or lawsuit, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees.</p>

            <p>This Agreement shall be subject to and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, excluding its conflict of laws principles. If any part of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in effect.</p>
            <p>A printed version of this Agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this Agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
